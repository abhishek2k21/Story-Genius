## Key Insight

> "This week is not about scale. It's about truth."

---

## Strategic Fork Questions

After running pilots, answer:

1. Did agencies use it without help?
2. Did they want more of it?
3. Did they hesitate on pricing?
4. Where is real demand strongest?

---

## Decision Framework

| Signal | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| "I'd replace an editor" | Double down |
| "Needs X feature" | Prioritize feature |
| "Too expensive" | Reposition pricing |
| "My clients won't accept AI" | Wrong ICP |

---

## Next Steps

1. Execute first pilot with prepared toolkit
2. Fill observation log during use
3. Conduct Day 38 feedback call
4. Create value proof from results
5. Decide Week 7 direction
