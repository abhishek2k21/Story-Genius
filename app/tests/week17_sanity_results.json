Every notification, every like, every endless scroll is a micro-reward, a dopamine hit engineered to be more immediately gratifying than, say, understanding the nuances of 19th-century Russian literature. It's not that we *can't* focus; it's that we're constantly presented with options that require *less* focus for *more* perceived reward. The takeaway? Attention isn't dwindling; it's being aggressively auctioned off, one ping at a time.",

He'd start reading about dinosaurs, then see a shiny button and forget all about the T-Rex. One day, Zip's friend, a wise old owl named Professor Hoot, showed him a trick. \"Try focusing on one thing at a time, Zip,\" Professor Hoot advised. \"Like building a tower, one block at a time.\" Zip tried it! He started with one block, then another, and slowly, he built a magnificent tower. He realized that focusing made learning much more fun and rewarding. From that day on, Zip practiced focusing, one block, one page, one dinosaur at a time. And you can too!",
