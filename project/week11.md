🗓️ WEEK 11 EXECUTION PLAN
Theme: Pricing Power, Team Shape & Founder Leverage
🎯 Week 11 North Star

By the end of Week 11:

You know how this business scales in people, pricing, and responsibility — without breaking margins or culture.

Week 11 is where you stop being:

“the builder who runs everything”
and become

the designer of a machine other people can run

WEEK 11 RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

❌ No new automation unless it removes human dependency

❌ No custom pricing per client

❌ No hiring yet

Week 11 is design & validation, not execution sprawl.

Silence

Hesitation

Objection type

Acceptance speed

Success

✔ At least one prospect does not push back
✔ You learn where resistance starts

🟢 DAY 71 — Pricing Floor & Ceiling Lock
Objective

Stop second-guessing pricing.

Deliverable (write this down):

Floor price → never go below

Target price → default

what not to do

Success

🟢 DAY 74 — Scale to 10 Clients (Soft Launch)
Objective

Test people + process limits.

Actions

Onboard up to 10 clients

Same workflow

No exceptions

Observe:

where process bends

Final CTO Guidance (Read carefully)

Week 11 is dangerous because:

Resist that.

From now on:

decisions > speed

clarity > hustle

systems > heroics

You’re building something that can outlive you being in every meeting.
