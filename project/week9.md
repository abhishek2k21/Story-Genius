🗓️ WEEK 9 EXECUTION PLAN
Theme: Controlled Scale (3–5 Clients Without Chaos)
🎯 Week 9 North Star

By the end of Week 9:

You can serve 3–5 paying clients simultaneously with stable quality, stable margins, and no founder firefighting.

Week 9 is not growth at all costs.
It’s scale with calm.

WEEK 9 RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

❌ No new features unless they remove manual work

❌ No custom logic per client

❌ No price negotiation experiments

✅ One workflow, many clients

✅ Automation over heroics

🟢 DAY 57 — Client #2 and #3 Onboarding
Objective

Prove delivery is repeatable, not lucky.

Actions

Onboard 2 new paying clients

Same pricing

Same SLA

Same workflow

Minimal hand-holding.

Success

✔ Onboarding < 1 hour per client
✔ No code changes required

🟢 DAY 58 — Delivery Stress Test
Objective

Ensure the system doesn’t bend under load.

Run:

Parallel batches (3–5 clients)

Peak-day simulation

Monitor:

latency

failures

retries

cost spikes

Success

✔ No cascading failures
✔ Costs stay within expected range

🟢 DAY 59 — Manual Touchpoint Audit
Objective

Find where humans are still required.

Do:

List every manual action you take

Categorize:

must keep

can automate

should kill

This becomes your automation backlog.

🟢 DAY 60 — Margin Optimization (Low-Risk Only)
Objective

Increase profit without risking quality.

Safe optimizations:

Reduce retries further

Cache winning hooks

Lower preview resolution

Batch LLM calls

Success

✔ Margin improves
✔ No quality regression

🟢 DAY 61 — Founder Load Check
Objective

Ensure you are not the bottleneck.

Answer honestly:

Can this run if I’m offline 1 day?

What breaks if I step away?

Fix one bottleneck only.

🟢 DAY 62 — Week 9 Report + Scale Decision
Deliverables

Week 9 progress report

Client count

Revenue

Decision

Scale to 10 clients

OR hold at 5 and optimize
