🗓️ WEEK 10 EXECUTION PLAN
Theme: Automation Backlog → Margin Expansion
🎯 Week 10 North Star

By the end of Week 10:

You remove the top manual bottlenecks, increase margins, and make the system safer to scale to 10+ clients.

Week 10 is about:

doing less

earning more

breaking fewer things

WEEK 10 RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ No new customer-facing features

❌ No new personas / styles / AI tricks

❌ No “nice to have” automation

Only automate:

things you already do every week.

🟢 DAY 63 — Automation Backlog Lock
Objective

Choose what NOT to automate as much as what to automate.

Actions

From your Week-9 manual audit:

Pick top 3 manual actions that:

happen frequently

block scale

don’t require judgment

Example candidates:

client setup

weekly report generation

batch scheduling

Deliverable

A locked list:

Automate now: 3 items
Defer: everything else

🟢 DAY 64 — Client Setup Automation
Objective

Onboarding must be boring and fast.

Build

One command / config:

{
  "client_name": "Agency X",
  "plan": "Agency",
  "quota": 1000,
  "persona": "Fast Explainer"

client

channels

limits

reporting hooks

Success

✔ Same format for all clients

🟢 DAY 66 — Batch Scheduling Automation
Objective

Remove “when should this run?” decisions.

Build

Batch scheduler:

daily / weekly cadence

off-peak execution

retry windows

Success

✔ No manual batch triggers
✔ Predictable load patterns

🟢 DAY 67 — Margin Expansion (Safe Levers Only)
Objective

Earn more without touching pricing.

Allowed levers

Cache top hooks

Reduce retries further

Lower intermediate resolutions

Batch LLM calls more aggressively

Measure

Cost/video before vs after

Quality delta (must be ~flat)

Success

✔ Margin improves
✔ No quality complaints

🟢 DAY 68 — Failure Injection Test
Objective

Ensure automation doesn’t create silent failures.

Simulate:

model timeout

quota exhaustion

Check:

alerts

Decision

Ready for 10 clients?

Or hold at 5 and harden?
