🗓️ WEEK 7 EXECUTION PLAN
Theme: Direction Lock, Monetization Proof & Commitment
🎯 Week 7 North Star

By the end of Week 7:

You know exactly who will pay, what they will pay for, and what NOT to build next.

Week 7 is where this becomes a company, not a long experiment.

WEEK 7 IS ABOUT DECISIONS, NOT FEATURES

No new engines.
No new AI models.
No platform expansion.

Only:

usage

money

commitment

🟢 DAY 43 — Run Pilot #1 (Hands-On)
Objective

Execute the first real pilot, end-to-end.

Actions

Onboard 1 agency

Generate 20–30 Shorts

Observe live usage

Fill observation log in real time

Rule

Do not fix anything mid-session unless it blocks usage.

🟢 DAY 44 — Feedback Call (Critical Day)
Objective

Extract unfiltered truth.

Ask only:

What felt magical?

What felt frustrating?

What did you not trust?

Would you use this next week?

Would you pay for this?

Do not defend the product.
Do not explain roadmap.

🟢 DAY 45 — Value Proof Compilation
Objective

Convert pilot usage into hard evidence.

Generate:

Before vs After

Time saved

Cost saved

Output consistency

This becomes:

sales asset

investor proof

internal compass

🟢 DAY 46 — Run Pilot #2 (Contrast Test)
Objective

Check if insights generalize.

Onboard a second agency (lighter touch)

Observe differences vs Pilot #1

If behavior is wildly different → ICP needs adjustment.

🟢 DAY 47 — Pricing Truth Test
Objective

Test willingness to pay.

Do NOT negotiate.

Present:

1 simple price

1 clear limit

1 clear outcome

Observe:

hesitation

objections

silence

excitement

🟢 DAY 48 — Direction Lock
Objective

Make irreversible decisions.

Answer in writing:

Primary ICP (locked)

Core use case (locked)

Top 3 features to invest in

Top 5 features to NOT build

This is your next 90-day compass.

🟢 DAY 49 — Week 7 Report + Commitment
Deliverable

Week 7 Progress Report that clearly states:

What users did

What they paid / would pay

What worked

What failed

What you’re committing to next

📄 EXPECTED WEEK 7 FINAL REPORT (TEMPLATE)
Week 7 Progress Report
Status: ✅ DIRECTION LOCKED

Highlights:
- Two agency pilots completed
- Clear usage patterns observed
- Pricing tested with real reactions
- ICP and core use case locked

Key Insight:
“This is what people will actually pay for.”

Decision:
- Double down on Agency Backend
- Freeze other directions
- Build only what supports this outcome

Final CTO Guidance (Very Important)

From Week 7 onward:

❌ No more “exploring”

❌ No more “maybe this feature”

✅ Build only what supports revenue

✅ Kill anything that doesn’t move money or usage

You’ve earned the right to be ruthless now.
