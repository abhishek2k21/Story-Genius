🗓️ WEEK 6 EXECUTION PLAN
Theme: Live Pilot, Truth-Seeking & Signal Extraction
🎯 Week 6 North Star

By end of Week 6:

At least one agency has actively used the platform, generated real Shorts, and given concrete feedback that changes the product.

This week is not about scale.
It’s about truth.

WEEK 6 PILLARS
Pillar	Why it matters
Live Pilot	Reality beats theory
Feedback Capture	Convert usage into insight
Rapid Iteration	Show responsiveness
Value Proof	Validate ROI narrative
Decision Clarity	Know what to build next
🟢 DAY 36 — Pilot Onboarding (Hands-on)
Objective

Get the first agency live with you watching.

Actions

Onboard 1 agency only

Create:

1 client

1 channel

Stay on call / WhatsApp if possible.

Success

✔ Agency completes first batch
✔ No blocking friction

🟢 DAY 37 — Observe, Don’t Fix Yet
Objective

Watch how they actually use it.

Do NOT jump in immediately.

Observe:

Where they hesitate

What they ask questions about

What they ignore

What they overuse

Deliverable

A raw observation log.

🟢 DAY 38 — Structured Feedback Capture
Objective

Turn feelings into data.

Ask only these 5 questions:

What felt magical?

What felt confusing?

What slowed you down?

Would you pay for this today?

What would make it a no-brainer?

Log answers verbatim.

🟢 DAY 39 — Fast Iteration (High-Signal Only)
Objective

Fix only high-impact friction.

Rules:

Max 2–3 changes

No architecture rewrites

No new AI features unless asked

Examples:

Default persona selection

Clearer report headline

Safer retry defaults

🟢 DAY 40 — Value Proof Assembly
Objective

Quantify value from the pilot.

Create:

Before vs After comparison

Time saved

Cost saved

Output consistency

This becomes sales ammo.

🟢 DAY 41 — Second Agency (Optional but Ideal)
Objective

Check if learnings generalize.

Onboard:

1 more agency

Minimal hand-holding

Compare behavior with first pilot.

🟢 DAY 42 — Week 6 Report + Strategic Fork
Objective

Decide the next 60 days.

Week 6 Report must answer:

Did agencies use it without help?

Did they want more of it?

Did they hesitate on pricing?

Where is real demand strongest?
