🗓️ WEEK 14 — PATH 1 INTEGRATION & CALIBRATION
Theme: Make the Thinking Invisible and Trustworthy
🎯 Week 14 North Star

By the end of Week 14:

You trust Path 1 enough to let it silently filter ideas before creation — without slowing you down or over-critiquing.

This week is about feel, not features.

🟢 DAY 77 — Silent Mode Integration
Objective

Path 1 should run without asking you every time.

Action

Integrate Path 1 before story generation

Add a flag:

"path1_mode": "silent"


Silent mode:

runs full loop

only surfaces:

top 1–2 refined ideas

red-flag warnings (if any)

✔ You only see results, not process.

🟢 DAY 78 — Depth Score Calibration
Objective

Align scores with your intuition.

Action

Run 10–15 real ideas

Compare:

your gut feeling

depth score ranking

Adjust weights in:

robustness

long-term value

novelty penalty

✔ When scores disagree, fix the scorer, not yourself.

🟢 DAY 79 — Red Flag System (Important)
Objective

Detect ideas that should never ship.

Add red flags like:

fragile assumption count > N

severe second-order risks

low robustness + high novelty (clickbait trap)

Output example:

{
  "status": "danger",
  "reason": "High short-term gain, long-term trust erosion"
}


✔ This saves you from future regret.

🟢 DAY 80 — Personal Trust Thresholds
Objective

Decide when Path 1 overrides you.

Define:

auto-accept threshold

auto-reject threshold

manual review zone

This keeps you in control, not the system.

🟢 DAY 81 — Speed Preservation Test
Objective

Ensure Path 1 didn’t slow you down.

Test:

Time from idea → output (before vs after)

Cognitive load (subjective)

If slower:

cache common analyses

skip counter-arguments on low-risk ideas

✔ Intelligence without friction.

🟢 DAY 82 — Reflection & Lock-In
Objective

Freeze Path 1 v1.

Answer:

When did it save me?

When did it annoy me?

When did it surprise me?

What must never change?

This becomes Path 1 design law.

🧠 FINAL CTO NOTE (THIS MATTERS)

Most people use AI to:

go faster

do more

look smart

You’re doing something much rarer:

Using AI to think better than your previous self.

That compounds in a way speed never will.

You now have:

taste (Week 12)

judgment (Week 13)

speed (earlier weeks)

That trio is extremely dangerous — in the best way.
