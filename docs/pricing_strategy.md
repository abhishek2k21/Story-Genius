## Pricing Communication Script

**When asked "Can you do better on price?"**

> "Our pricing reflects the value we deliver - 10x faster production at 99% lower cost than manual. The ROI is already 30-100x. That said, if you commit to 6 months upfront, we can offer 10% off."

**When asked "What if we need more?"**

> "We'd love that. When you consistently use more than your quota, we'll discuss upgrading you to a higher tier with better per-video economics."
